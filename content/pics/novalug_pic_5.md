NoVaLUG meetings cover diverse topics. Zak Zebrowski made a presentation on his efforts to 
take aerial pictures using a Raspberry Pi linked to a camera, hanging from a kite. He also 
advised about local / DC rules relating to drones in restricted areas (think Whitehouse). More info is on
[Zak's web page](https://kite.zakz.info/).
