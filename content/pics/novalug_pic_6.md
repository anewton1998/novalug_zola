Past NoVaLUG Leadership

![](/pics/saints.jpg)

Mark Fearer | Peter Larsen | John Kennedy

Mark and John recently stepped up to assume leadership of NoVaLUG after many years of exemplary service by Greg Pryzby. Peter has performed many sevices for the LUG over a period of several years.
Mark resigned from his co-leadership role in the summer of 2019. Luggers are grateful for his service, especially for his tireless creation of videos of meetings, including live feeds.
